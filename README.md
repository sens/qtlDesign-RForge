# R/qtlDesign: R-Forge Git Mirror

This is a Git repository mirroring the Subversion (SVN) repository for
the [qtlDesign R-Forge
project](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=52).

The R/qtlDesign package is an R package for the design of QTL
(quantitative trait loci) experiments.  For more details on the theory
and use of the package, please see the following paper.

> Sen et al. (2007) R/qtlDesign: Inbred line cross experimental
> design.  Mammalian Genome 18:87-93

To install the project from CRAN use:

    install.packages("qtlDesign")
	
The developmental version of the package can be installed using:

    install.packages("qtlDesign", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
	
The project is in maintenance mode, i.e. only small improvements and
bug fixes are planned in the near future.

Since this repository uses the Git conversion of the parent SVN repo,
it may be useful to see [how to work with
git-svn](https://gist.github.com/rickyah/7bc2de953ce42ba07116).
